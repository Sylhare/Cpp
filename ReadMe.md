# C++

C++ is an evolution of the C language but with more modern features for a more diverse use than the C.

## Introduction

C++ is a low level programming language, meaning that it is closer to the computer internal mechanism (close to the metal).
This language strength are:

- Fast - for high performance software
- Multiplatform - can be executed in Windows, MacOS, Linux without code transoformation
- It has [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming), [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) and [generic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming) programming features
- Famous - it is used for multiple applications and has a lot of librairies available

## Getting Started

To start coding in c++ you would need three things:
    - A text editor
    - A compiler
    - A debugger

Thanksfully there are options where all three are integrated in a IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
A standard and famous IDE to use would be [code::blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26). If you are on windows, choose the version with [MinGW] which is a c++ compiler.
If you are on Linux (debian, ubuntu):

```bash
apt-get install build-essential codeblocks
```
